  - You heal the wounded mercenary. After the battle, the two mercenaries thank you
    for the help. Your health refill completely !
  - You start fighting the robots. With now 4 of you, the robots are meaningless.
    After the fight, the mercenary gives you all his ressources. He doesn't need
    it anymore. Your ressources refill completly !
  - You continue your road without helping them. Living on this planet is not easy
    and being selfaware is essential over here. You receive nothing from them...
  answers:
  - Today wounded people are tomorrow allies.
  - We just needed some training.
  - Mercenaries are doomed to die on battlefields, no matter the issues.
