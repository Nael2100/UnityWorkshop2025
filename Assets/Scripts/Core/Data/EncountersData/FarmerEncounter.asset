  title: Hunt and harvest, nothing more !
  text: "Tell me, you are hunters, right ? You all smell blood and rust. I have a
    mission : a big rodent devastates all plantations, for weeks now. I tried to
    warn authorities, but nothing happened. Would you hunt it for me, and bring me
    its skin ? It\u2019s an excellent insulating material."
  resolvedText: 'Here your reward : '
  answers:
  - Hunt above all, but the beast is ours.
  - "We\u2019re hunting humans and robots, no common rodent."
  - Hunting will never hurt, and we have enough ressources.
